### Dot Experiment Fundamentals & Resources

##### My Frequencies:
- 1.5 Hz (2 syllable units)
- 1 Hz (3 syllable units)
- 0.75 Hz (4 syllable units)

##### Resources:
- [pygame documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
- [pygame image documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/image.html)
- [pygame animation tips](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs5nm/topics/pygame/drawing/)
- [fix your timestep](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/)
- [delta time & pygame](https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/3blsr3/jittering_movement/)

##### Ideas/next steps:
- Make dot animation continuous
- Be able to analyze all dot times to ensure approx one min apart
- Be able to input the frequency?
  - I've got this working but it could be better maybe... Possibly want to make it use subject number to determine condition (whether it should be 0.75 Hz, 1 Hz or 1.5 Hz). I'll ask.
- ~~Set up background as fullscreen black window (animation will be in smaller white box)~~ **DONE**
